**Robotics-Academy** supports Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and other distributions), MacOS and Windows. The installation has been greatly simplified, as all the required dependencies are already pre-installed in the Robotics-Academy Docker Image. The users of this release should:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on their machines
2. Run the [RADI (Robotics-Academy Docker Image)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jderobot/robotics-academy/tags) using the exercise specific launch instructions
3. Clone [Robotics-Academy repository](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy).

    Download the Academy software. With git Shell clone the repository as in Linux and run the exercices with `CMD` o powershell

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jderobot/academy.git
    ```
    
Enjoy :-)
